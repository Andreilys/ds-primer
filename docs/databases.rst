Introduction
============
Databases can be explained at the most basic level as a way of storing, organizing and retrieving information.
The two main kinds of databases are Relational and Non-Relational (or NoSQL). Within both categories are a host of other database types which the following sections will explore in detail.

Why It's Important
----------------
Often times a data scientist will have to work with a database in order to retrieve the data they need to build their models or to do data analysis.
Thus it's important that a scientist familiarize themselves with the different types of databases and how to query them.

Relational
===========
A relational database is one of the simplest database type and can be easily explained

Types
-------
While there are many different kinds of relational databases, the most popular have proven to be:
  - PostgreSQL:
  - Oracle:
  - MySQL:
  - Microsoft SQL Server:
  - DB2:

Advantages
----------
  - SQL standards are well defined and commonly accepted

Disadvantages
-------------
  - Poor performance with unstrucutred data types due to schema and type constraints


.. Non-relational/NoSQL:

Non-relational/NoSQL
===========

Types
-------
While there are many different kinds of relational databases, the most popular have proven to be:
  - PostgreSQL:
  - Oracle:
  - MySQL:
  - Microsoft SQL Server:
  - DB2:

Advantages
----------
  - SQL standards are well defined and commonly accepted

Disadvantages
-------------
